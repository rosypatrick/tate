## Form Implementation

### HTML Structure

```html
<form class="lead-form" id="contact-form" data-form-type="contact">
  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="name">Full Name*</label>
    <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required>
  </div>
  <!-- Additional fields -->
  <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Submit</button>
</form>
```

### Form Validation

Client-side validation using a combination of:
- HTML5 validation attributes (required, type)
- JavaScript validation for complex rules
- Error messages appear inline below each field

### Form Submission Process

1. Validate form data client-side
2. Submit via AJAX to prevent page reload
3. Show loading indicator during submission
4. Display success message after submission
5. Reset form for potential additional entries
6. Track conversion in analytics

### Success Path

After form submission:
1. Thank you message displays immediately
2. Data is sent to CRM/marketing automation
3. Automated email confirmation sent within minutes
4. Sales team notified for high-priority leads
5. Lead scoring assigns priority level
6. Follow-up workflow initiated

## Lead Nurturing Integration

### Email Sequences

Form submissions trigger appropriate nurturing sequences:
- **Contact Form**: Sales-focused follow-up sequence
- **Content Download**: Educational nurturing sequence
- **Quote Request**: Urgent sales outreach sequence

### Lead Scoring

Points assigned based on:
- Form type (Quote = 50pts, Contact = 30pts, Download = 10pts)
- Fields completed (Phone number = +10pts)
- Project timeline (Immediate = +20pts)
- Project type (varies by business priority)

### CRM Integration

All lead data syncs to CRM with:
- Source tracking (UTM parameters)
- Session data (pages viewed, time on site)
- Score and qualification status
- Assigned sales representative

## Optimization Framework

### A/B Testing Schedule

Regular testing of:
- Form length (current vs. shorter versions)
- Button copy and color
- Form placement on page
- Required vs. optional fields
- Incentives for completion

### Conversion Rate Benchmarks

- **Contact Form**: Target 4-6% conversion rate
- **Content Download**: Target 20-30% conversion rate
- **Quote Request**: Target 8-12% conversion rate

### Optimization Process

1. Monthly review of form analytics
2. Identify drop-off points in form completion
3. Test variations of problematic elements
4. Implement winning versions
5. Document learnings for future improvements

## Technical Implementation Notes
