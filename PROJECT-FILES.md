   - External resources minimized
   - CSS optimized for critical rendering path
   - Deferred loading for non-critical scripts

4. **Compatibility**:
   - Components tested on modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
   - Mobile-responsive design for all elements

5. **Integration Points**:
   - Newsletter component can be added to any page section

## Next Steps

1. Integrate these files into the production environment
2. Connect form submissions to CRM/marketing automation platform
3. Set up analytics tracking for all conversion points
4. Implement A/B testing framework for continuous optimization
